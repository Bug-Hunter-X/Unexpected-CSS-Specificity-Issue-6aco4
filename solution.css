The solution involves using more specific selectors to target the intended elements. This prevents unintended styling of other elements with the same class `box`:

```css
.container .box {
  background-color: lightblue; /* This will also be corrected */
}

/*Corrected selectors */
.container > .box {
  background-color: lightblue; /* Only targets direct children */
}
.container .box.special {
  background-color: lightgreen;
}
```

By adding more context to the selector using a child combinator `>` (for direct children) or additional classes, we ensure the styling applies only to the intended elements.
