The following CSS rule unintentionally targets elements with the class `box` inside of elements with the class `container`, due to the lack of specificity in the selector. This can lead to unexpected styling, particularly if the same class `box` is used in other parts of the page.:

```css
.container .box {
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```
